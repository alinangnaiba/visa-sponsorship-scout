Data coming from a .csv file downloaded [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers)

Update is pulled from the CSV file coming from the url above. There is a background job running every day to check for updates [here](https://github.com/alinangnaiba/sponsorship-scout-bg/tree/master).
